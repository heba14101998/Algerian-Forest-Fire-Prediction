# Algerian Forest Fire Prediction

Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a forest fire will occur based on input features based on environmental and weather data. This is a binary classification problem, where the model needs to learn the patterns that distinguish between instances where a fire occurred ("fire") and instances where no fire occurred ("not fire").

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Availability:** The dataset provides historical information on weather and environmental conditions and whether fires occurred.
* **Feature Importance:**  Determining which features have the strongest impact on fire occurrence is crucial for model accuracy.
* **Model Performance:**  The model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify future fire events.


This repository contains code and resources for predicting forest fires in Algeria using machine learning.

## Project Overview

Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment and human safety. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of forest fires in Algeria, using historical data and environmental factors.

<!-- ### Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source of dataset] and consists of [brief description of the dataset, including features]. 

### Model

We implemented [mention the machine learning model used] for predicting forest fire probability. The model was trained and evaluated using [mention training and evaluation metrics]. -->

## Getting Started
