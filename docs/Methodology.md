### 2) Data Acquisition & Preparation

1. **Data Source:** Download the Algerian Forest Fires dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Exploration:**
    - Analyze the data using Pandas (e.g., `describe`, `info`, visualizations).
    - Document your findings (e.g., in a `notebooks/EDA_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb` notebook).
4. **Feature Engineering:**
    - **Feature Selection:**  Implement methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance analysis to select the most relevant features.
    - **Transformations:** Apply one-hot encoding for categorical features and normalization or standardization for numerical features.
    - **Feature Creation:** Generate new features by combining existing ones or by applying domain knowledge.
5. **Hypothesis Testing:**
    - Formulate hypotheses about the impact of features on fire occurrence.
    - Use statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared test, t-test) to assess the hypotheses.
    - Refine feature engineering based on the test results.
6. **Data Splitting:** Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

### 3) Model Development & Training 

1. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate models for classification (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).
2. **Model Training:** Train the models on the training dataset.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Try different combinations of hyperparameters for each model.

### 4) Model Evaluation & Comparison 

1. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate trained models on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. **Visualizations:** Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations for model performance (confusion matrices, ROC curves, feature importance plots).
3. **Model Comparison:**  Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one based on your chosen evaluation metrics.

### 5) Packaging & Deployment

1. **Packaging:** 
   - Create a `setup.py` file to configure the Python package. 
   -  Include essential metadata (name, version, author, dependencies, etc.).
2. **Linting:**
   - Use a linting tool (`PyLint`, `flake8`) to enforce coding style and find potential errors.
   - Configure linting in the development environment (e.g., VS Code). 
3. **Publish Pakage:**
   -  Publish the package to PyPI:
     - Follow the PyPI instructions: [https://pypi.org/help/](https://pypi.org/help/)
     - Build a distribution package (e.g., `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`).
     - Upload the package to PyPI. **(my package is already published at [https://pypi.org/project/forest-fire/](https://pypi.org/project/forest-fire/))**

### 6) Versioning Controlling and DVC Studio
1. **Version Control:**
   - Use Git and GitHub to version control the code and configuration files.
   - Use DVC to version control the data, models, and experiments artifcats.
   - Create a remote DVC repository (e.g., on Google Drive). 
2. **DVC Studio:** 
    - Use DVC Studio (a web-based interface for managing and visualizing DVC projects) to track project's data, code, and experiments.
    - Visualize the relationships between files and stages.
    - Analyze metrics and compare experiment results.
    - **Link to my DVC Studio project:** [https://studio.dvc.ai/user/heba14101998/projects/Algerian-Forest-Fire-Prediction-i0w7iu47ad](https://studio.dvc.ai/user/heba14101998/projects/Algerian-Forest-Fire-Prediction-i0w7iu47ad)
3. **Continuous Integration:**
   -  Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., on GitHub Actions) to:
     -  Run tests automatically when changes are made.
     -  Build and publish new package versions to PyPI.
     -  Run new experiment.
     -  Update the DVC remote repository with new data, models, and artifacts.

### 7) Project Documentation & Communication

1. **README.md:** Create a comprehensive README file explaining the project, its installation, usage, and how to run experiments.
2. **Code Documentation:** Use docstrings to document the Python code.
3. **Project Website:** Consider creating a simple website (e.g., using GitHub Pages) to host project documentation and information.

**Tools & Technologies**

- **Python Packaging:** `setuptools`
- **PyPI:**  The Python Package Index (where you will publish the package)
- **DVC:**  Data Version Control (for managing the data, code, and models)
- **DVC Studio:**  A web-based interface for DVC
- **Linting:** `flake8`, `pylint`, or similar tools
- **Hypothesis Testing:** `hypothesis` library
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Additional Notes:**

- **Best Practices:**  Always strive for clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- **Versioning:** Utilize DVC effectively to track changes to your data, code, and models.
- **Testing:** Thorough testing ensures that your package is reliable and works correctly.
- **Deployment:** Make your package easily accessible through PyPI.
- **Deployment Strategies:** Explore ways to deploy your model into a production environment (e.g., deploying a web service or using a cloud platform).
- **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps):** Consider using MLOps practices to manage model training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining.
